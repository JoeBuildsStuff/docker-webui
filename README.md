## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docker-manager.git
   cd docker-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Running with Docker

Alternatively, you can run Docker Manager inside a Docker container. This is a convenient way to manage the application and its dependencies.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t docker-manager .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**

    To allow Docker Manager to access and manage your host's Docker environment, you need to mount the Docker socket into the container.

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name docker-manager-app docker-manager
    ```
    *   `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    *   `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.
    *   `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`: Mounts the Docker socket from the host into the container. This is crucial for the application to be able to interact with your Docker daemon.
    *   `--name docker-manager-app`: Assigns a name to the running container for easier management.
    *   `docker-manager`: Specifies the image to run.

3.  **Access Docker Manager:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4.  **To stop the container:**
    ```bash
    docker stop docker-manager-app
    ```

5.  **To remove the container (after stopping):**
    ```bash
    docker rm docker-manager-app
    ```

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with App Router
- **UI Components**: Custom components using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling
- **Icons**: [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Docker Integration**: Native Docker CLI commands via Node.js child_process

## 📝 Technical Architecture

The application uses a hybrid architecture with:

- **Server-side Components**: For data fetching directly from the Docker daemon
- **Client-side Components**: For interactive UI elements and state management
- **API Routes**: For secure communication with the Docker engine
- **Docker CLI Integration**: Executes Docker commands and parses results into structured data
